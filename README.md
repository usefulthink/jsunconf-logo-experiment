# experimenting with the jsunconf-logo

A three.js implementation inspired by box-logo on the new [jsunconf website](http://2016.jsunconf.eu) made by [@silkine](https://twitter.com/silkine).

We were curious if we could achieve something visually similar to the image seen on the website using WebGL-rendering (that original was rendered using blender's cycles raytracing-engine).

The result can be seen [here](https://usefulthink.com/jsunconf), or in a fully sourcemapped version [here](https://usefulthink.com/jsunconf/sourcemapped.html).

The implementation as it is now took about 6 hours to write, so there is still some polishing and detail-work to do...
